# Terraform Tutorials

This is my Terraform learning and experimentation repo! This repository contains step-by-step tutorials, hands-on projects, and reusable modules as I deepen my knowledge of Infrastructure-as-Code using Terraform.

Each folder in this repo is a self-contained tutorial or mini-project. It includes Terraform files (`*.tf`), documentation, and sometimes diagrams or outputs.
